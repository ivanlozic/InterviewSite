    "question": "What are Attributes and how do you use them?",
    "answer": " Each tag has additional attributes that change the way the tag behaves or is displayed. For example, a <input> tag has a type attribute, which you can use to specify whether it's a text field, checkbox, radio button or one of many more options. Attributes are specified directly after the name of the tag, inside the two angled brackets. They should only ever appear in opening tags or in self-closing tags. But, they can never be in closing tags."
