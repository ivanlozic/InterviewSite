              <strong>Research the company and the role beforehand.</strong>
              This will help you understand the company's mission and values, as
              well as the specific requirements and expectations for the role.

              <strong>Prepare for common interview questions.</strong> Some
              common questions include: "Tell me about yourself," "Why do you
              want to work for this company," and "What are your strengths and
              weaknesses?" It's a good idea to practice answering these types of
              questions beforehand so you feel more comfortable and confident
              during the interview.

              <strong>Listen carefully</strong> to the interviewer's questions
              and take your time answering. It's important to fully understand
              the question before responding, and to provide clear and concise
              answers.

              <strong>Follow up after the interview.</strong> It's a good idea
              to send a thank-you note to the interviewer(s) expressing your
              appreciation for the opportunity and reiterating your interest in
              the role. This can help to keep you top-of-mind as the company
              makes its hiring decision.

              <strong>Plan your schedule to arrive 10-15 minutes early.</strong>
              Map out your route to the interview location so you can be sure to
              arrive on time. Consider doing a practice run. If you're taking
              public transportation, identify a backup plan if there are delays
              or closures.
